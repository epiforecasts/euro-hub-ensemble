figure_example_ensemble_cap <- "Ensemble forecasts of weekly incident cases in Germany over periods of increasing SARS-CoV-2 variants Delta (B.1.617.2, left) and Omicron (B.1.1.529, right). Black indicates observed data. Coloured ribbons represent each weekly forecast of 1-4 weeks ahead (showing median, 50%, and 90% probability). For each variant, forecasts are shown over an x-axis bounded by the earliest dates at which 5% and 99% of sequenced cases were identified as the respective variant of concern, while vertical dotted lines indicate the approximate date that the variant reached dominance (>50% sequenced cases)."
